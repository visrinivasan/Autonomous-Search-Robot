# Autonomous Search Navigation Robot

An iRobot Roomba was used to navigate through an unknown (unexplored) terrain and identify a predefined object. The framework employed was built using ROS.

Microsoft Kinect was used for Navigation (using RGB- D SLAM) and path planning was made efficient using the in-built move_base library in ROS which uses A* algorithm. Real time frame capture was done using a HD Camera and Object detection on the frame was done using SIFT and SURF algorithms.
